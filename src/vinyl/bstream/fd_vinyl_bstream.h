/* Client modifications to a vinyl key-val store are sequenced into
   total order by the vinyl tile and encoded into a stream of direct I/O
   friendly blocks (a "bstream").  A bstream has the strict mathematical
   property that a sufficient contiguous range of blocks ("the bstream's
   past") can be used to reconstruct the exact state of the vinyl
   key-val store at the bstream's "present" and then with a high
   probability of detecting random data corruption.  Further, the
   bstream's past can be efficiently and continuously updated at the
   same time the bstream is being modified with bounded space and time
   overheads.

   To introduce concepts and give more details:

   - sequence space: Every byte in a bstream has a sequence number that
     is that byte's offset from the leading bstream byte.  sequence
     numbers are 64-bit and wrap cyclicly (sequence wrapping is not a
     concern on practical timescales but the code handles it).

   - blocks: bstream bytes are accessed at block granularity.
     FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ gives the block byte size.  bstream
     blocks always start at FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ multiples.

   - history: A bstream reader/writer maintains four block sequence
     numbers: seq_ancient, seq_past, seq_present, seq_future with
     seq_ancient <= seq_past <= seq_present <= seq_future (cyclic).
     These partition bstream sequence space into four regions:

       [seq_ancient,seq_past)    (cyclic) is antiquity: these blocks have been written and forgotten (no read, no write)
       [seq_past,   seq_present) (cyclic) is past:      these blocks have been written               (read only)
       [seq_present,seq_future)  (cyclic) is present:   these blocks are being written               (write only)
       [seq_future, seq_ancient) (cyclic) is future:    these blocks have not been written           (no read, no write)

   - synchronization: The distinction between antiquity and the future
     is that blocks from antiquity will not be reused until the physical
     hardware has recorded the current location of the bstream's past.

   - recovery: the bstream's past is sufficient to exactly reconstruct
     the state of the key-val store at seq_present.

   - compaction: a bstream writer can cheaply prove whether or not a
     block is needed for recovery (blocked not needed for recovery are
     "garbage") and precisely track the amount of garbage in the
     bstream's past.  The writer can use this information to decide when
     and how to continuously reorganize the bstream's past to yield a
     minimally sized past asymptotically with a bounded amount of
     garbage during transients ("compaction").

   - compression: Compaction can also statelessly re-encode the storage
     represetation of pairs.  This will naturally compress seldom used
     pair data in the background while frequently used pairs will be
     stored uncompressed (RAW encoded) for speed.

   - encoding: A bstream encodes a key-val pair as follows:

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------- <- seq (FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ multiple)
     ctl           8          type PAIR, val encoding style and val_esz  ^ ^
     key           key_sz     fix sz, 8 multiple                         | | fd_vinyl_bstream_phdr_t
     val_sz        4          decoded val_sz           fd_vinyl_info_t ^ | |
     app info      INFO_SZ-4  app info                                 v | v
     val           val_esz    encoded according to style                 |
     zero padding  zpad_sz    in [0,FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ)           | pair_sz (FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ multiple)
     hash_trail    8                                                   ^ |
     hash_blocks   8                           FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_FTR_SZ v v
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     There is much nuance in the above:

     * Since sizeof(fd_vinyl_bstream_phdr_t) + FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_FTR_SZ is
       less than FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ, a pair with a small enough
       encoded val can fit in a single block.  It is not possible to
       encode multiple pairs in a single block though.

     * hash_trail covers all the pair's trailing blocks.  hash_trail for
       a single block item is the bstream's hash seed.  hash_blocks is
       the hash of the leading block with hash_trail as the seed.

     * Hashing is block oriented to create a single easily optimized
       case for software and hardware to target.  Implementations can
       optimize and specialize data integrity hash functions to the case
       that maps a 64-bit seed and a FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ aligned
       and FD_VINYL_BSTREAM_BLOCK_SZ footprint input buffer to a 64-bit
       output for all hashing operations.

     * The hashes are located at the pair end so that pairs can be
       streamed to storage cut-through / zero-copy style by writers with
       no seeking.  Reading into memory can likewise be done with no
       intermediate copies of the pair (especially for RAW encoded
       pairs).

     * Hashing the trailing blocks and hash chaining the leading block
       allows updating pair metadata (e.g.  renaming a pair, copying a
       pair, moving a pair, etc) without requiring rehashing all the
       data while maintaining strong data integrity protections (e.g.
       can detect with high probability whether the leading block has
       been mismatched from its trailing blocks).

     * Storing both hashes also allows fast high integrity bstream
       iteration.  Specifically, iterators can fully validate small
       pairs and partially validate large pairs (the pair key, pair
       metadata and leading pair val bytes are valid and the trailing
       val bytes are matched to these bytes) cheaply (i.e. without
       needing to compute a full pair hash) with very low cost in
       storage or overhead on read or write.

     * The hashes are computed with the hash fields zeroed.  The hash
       fields are then set when the pair is written.

     * This representation is cheaply relocatable (this is particularly
       important for compaction).  For example, we could include the
       bstream seq in the pair header for extra redundancy (e.g. can
       potentially estimate bstream's past if the bstream's metadata
       gets corrupted) and extra data integrity checks.  But then we'd
       have to either:

       - Recompute pair hashes when reorganizing the bstream's past
         during background compaction (which would prevent generic I/O
         hardware offload of bulk copies used for compaction).

       - Exclude seq from the block header hashing (which helps some
         but we'd still need to update seq in the header and thus
         prevent generic I/O hardware offload of bulk copies).

       - Keep seq constant during the compaction.  This would turn seq
         into an indicator of when the pair was first created (or
         recreated if after an erase or move).  Ignoring sequence wrap,
         this could preserve some data integrity checking (e.g. seq
         aligned and at or before the pair's current position) but this
         weakens the sync metadata redundancy benefits of including seq
         (can't just search for a contiguous range of well formatted
         blocks and use seq to get a bstream's past range estimate).

       - ...

       Instead, we go the simpler, faster and more flexible route.  We
       omit bstream seq here from the pair.  This allows pairs to be
       moved around in the bstream with simple bulk copies.  Simpler
       code, more application pair metadata and faster background
       compaction.

   - control blocks: the bstream can contain control blocks to support
     recovery.  A control block can only refer to bstream blocks before
     it in the bstream.  Thus, they are always garbage from the point of
     view of compaction as they can be always be removed from the
     bstream's past once they are at seq_past.

   - zero padding: one type of control block is zero padding.  These
     can be inserted by the bstream writer in order ensure sets of
     blocks are kept continguous in the underlying physical storage
     (e.g. making sure an encoded pair is never split across two
     physical volumes).

   - partitions: another type of control block is a partition.  The
     bstream writer can insert partitions periodically to allow the
     bstream past to be quickly partitioned at object boundaries into
     approximately uniform slices that can be used for parallel
     recovery.  These partitions also include the number of erases and
     moves that happend in the partition to aid in parallel recovery (to
     optionally tightly bound the size of temporary data structures at
     start).

   - hot or not: the metadata for all pairs at seq_present is always
     available fast O(1) to concurent vinyl users.  This includes a
     small amount of application info (like balances, expirations, etc). */
