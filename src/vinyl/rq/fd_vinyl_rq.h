/* A fd_vinyl_req_t describes a batch request to a vinyl tile.  Batch
   requests from a client are processed in order from that client.  The
   individual items in a batch request can be processed in _any_ order
   (including concurrently).  Thus ...

   IMPORTANT SAFETY TIP!  The client promises that all items in a
   request are logically independent such that they can be safely
   processed in an arbitrary order / in parallel.

   The simplest way to ensure this is to keep all keys in a request
   unique.  That being said, repeated keys in a request will generally
   "do the right thing" in the sense that the result can be interpreted
   as though each item in the request executed in some order (with some
   technical caveats for the advanced optimization of processing batch
   items before receiving a completion).  Batch requests from different
   clients can be arbitrarily interleaved at batch request granularity.

   As such, a batch request executes _atomically_ relative to other
   requests.

   Note though that concurrent meta readers see individual batch items
   complete as they happen.  Specifically, except for "move", individual
   items in a batch complete atomically in whatever order they were
   processed.  (During the move of an individual item for the current
   implementation, there is a brief momment where a concurrent meta
   reader could observe both key_src and key_dst as not present.)
   Similarly clients doing speculative processing will see individual
   batch items complete atomically (including move) in whatever order
   they are being processed (which is the point of speculative
   processing). */

       ACQUIRE (for read)

         SUCCESS - acquired the corresponding pair key.  The pair val
                   and pair info can be found via the corresponding
                   val_gaddr in the shared data cache.  This location
                   will be stable until the pair is released.  info will
                   have the current pair metadata (including the val
                   byte size), val will have the current pair val.

         AGAIN   - there was a conflicting acquire on pair key, try
                   again after the conflicting acquire has been
                   released.  That is, pair key is currently
                   acquired-for-modify (this includes pair key in the
                   process of being created).

       ACQUIRE (for modify)

         SUCCESS - acquired the corresponding pair key.  The pair val
                   and pair info can be found via the corresponding
                   val_gaddr in the shared data cache.  This location
                   will be stable until the pair is released.

                   If pair key exists and ignore was _not_ set, info
                   will contain the current pair metadata (including the
                   val byte size), val contain the current pair val and
                   the val region will be sized to the greater of the
                   current val byte size and the requested max val byte
                   size.

                   If pair key exists and ignore _was_ set, info will
                   contain the _current_ pair metadata (_but_ with a val
                   byte size of 0), val will be empty and the region
                   will be sized to the requested max val byte size.

                   If pair key did not exist, the pair info will be all
                   zeros, val will be empty and the val region will be
                   sized to the requested max val byte size.

         INVAL   - pair key existed and exclusive was set

         KEY     - pair key did not exist and create was not set

         AGAIN   - there was a conflicting acquire on pair, try again
                   after conflicting acquire(s) have been released.
                   That is, pair key is currently acquired-for-read one
                   or more times or acquired-for-modify.

       RELEASE

         SUCCESS - released the corresponding pair key.  The key-val
                   store was updated appropriately.  In particular:

                   When releasing an acquire-for-modify _with_ modify
                   set, the modification "happened" (i.e. is now part of
                   the bstream's past).  This includes creating or
                   erasing a pair.  The cached pair info gave the
                   modified pair info (including the updated pair val
                   byte size).

                   When releasing an acquire-for-modify _without_ modify
                   set, the modification was cancelled.  If the ignore
                   flag _was_set, the vinyl tile assumed the cached info
                   and/or val were clobbered by the client during the
                   acquire.  If the ignore flag was _not_ set, the vinyl
                   tile assumed the client did not alter any pair value
                   or pair info _at_ _any_ _time_ _during_ _the_
                   _acquire_ (such that the cached values and any
                   speculations on those cached values during the
                   acquire were valid).  Note that when releasing an
                   acquire-for-modify-with-ignore, the implicily
                   clobbered the cached pair info val byte size and
                   cached pair val for pairs that had a non-zero val
                   size immediately before the acquire.  Since the
                   client probably didn't know if the val size was zero
                   beforehand, it is strongly recommended that
                   acquire-for-modify-with-ignore only be canceled via a
                   release-with-ignore.

                   TL;DR If client never wrote to the cached pair info
                   or cached pair val on an
                   acquire-for-modify-without-ignore, the modification
                   can be cancelled fast with a release-without-modify.
                   In all other cases, a modification should be
                   cancelled via a release-without-modify-with-ignore.

                   Note that release-with-modify of an acquire-for-read
                   is considered a catastrophe (the client modified data
                   it promised not to change and may have corrupted
                   state of themselves, other clients and the store
                   itself).  Overrunning pair cache storage (the client
                   set the pair info val_sz to something larger than the
                   acquire-with-modify val_max) is also treated as a
                   catastrophe for similar reasons.

         INVAL   - the corresponding key (BY_KEY) / val (~BY_KEY) did
                   not appear to be to an acquired pair

       ERASE

         SUCCESS - the corresponding key was erased

         KEY     - the corresponding key did not exist

         AGAIN   - corresponding key is currently acquired for something
                   (including read, modify or create), try again after
                   conflicting acquires have been released

       MOVE

         SUCCESS - the corresponding src_key was renamed to the
                   corresponding dst_key.  If dst_key existed before the
                   move, it was atomically erased before renaming pair
                   src_key.  The new pair dst_key has the pair info and
                   pair val of the old pair src_key.

                   Note that a move from src_key to src_key is treated
                   as a no-op that immediately succeeds (with no
                   checking, for example, whether or not src_key even
                   exists).

         KEY     - the corresponding src_key did not exist

         AGAIN   - there was at least one conflicting acquire on src_key
                   and/or dst_key.  Try again after the conflicting
                   acquires have been released.

       FETCH - ignored

       FLUSH - ignored

       TRY

         SUCCESS - the client is clear to try a speculative
                   (non-blocking) read of the corresponding key.  The
                   key was located in the data cache region at the given
                   val_gaddr at the start of the try.

         KEY     - the corresponding key did not exist to try

         AGAIN   - the corresponding key was acquired-for-modify
                   (includes create), try again after conflicting
                   acquires have been released

       TEST

         SUCCESS - the speculative read was successful

         INVAL   - the corresponding try never started (i.e. try failed
                   with KEY or AGAIN)

         CORRUPT - the corresponding try failed (i.e. the pair was
                   potentially changed during the speculation)

     If these are set to a positive number before sending the request,
     the caller can detect individual items as they finish processing
     (and then access the pair val and pair info via the corresponding
     val_gaddr on success) before receiving the completion (with some
     caveats for requests with redundant keys described in
     case_acquire). */
