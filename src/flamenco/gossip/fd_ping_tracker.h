/* The gossip network amplifies inbound traffic.  For example, a node
   can send us a small pull request, with an empty bloom filter and then
   get back a very large set of pull responses.

   This is not good because an attacker can use it as a reflection
   vector for a DDoS attack.  To prevent this, we enforce a rule that we
   can only send data to peers that have responded to a ping request.

   The fd_ping_tracker maintains a metadata about the peers available to
   ping, who has been pinged, and who has responded, so that we can
   quickly determine before sending a message if we should send it or
   not.

   Any peer which has tried to send us a gossip message within the last
   two minutes is eligible to be pinged, except nodes with at least one
   SOL of stake which are exempt from ping requirements.

   Once a peer has been pinged, we wait up to twenty seconds for a
   response before trying again.  We repeatedly retry pinging the peer
   until the peer responds, or their most recent mesage becomes older
   than two minutes.

   Once a peer is validated by responding to a ping with a valid pong,
   it is considered valid for 20 minutes.  After 18 minutes, we will
   begin pinging the peer again, every twenty seconds, to refresh the
   peer. */
